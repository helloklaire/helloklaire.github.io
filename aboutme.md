Hello there! I'm Klaire. I'm an academic-slash-data enthusiast. I like figuring out how humans and machines interact. I also want to understand the human condition, one dataset at a time.

### My work.

### Collaborators.
I stand in the shoulder of giants. I would not be where I currently am if not for my great colleagues. 

### On pronouns
I identify as non-binary and use she/they pronouns. It means you can use she/her or they/them pronouns when referring to me. Different nonbinary people may use different pronouns. Many nonbinary people use “they” while others use “he” or “she,” and still others use other pronouns. If you’re not sure what pronouns someone uses, ask. Asking whether someone should be referred to as “he,” “she,” “they,” or another pronoun may feel awkward at first, but is one of the simplest and most important ways to show respect for someone’s identity.
