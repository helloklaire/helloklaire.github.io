Hello there! I'm Klaire. I'm an academic-slash-data enthusiast. I like figuring out how humans and machines interact. I also want to understand the human condition, one dataset at a time.

### My work.

### Collaborators.
I stand in the shoulder of giants. I would not be where I currently am if not for my great colleagues. 

### A bit personal.
Yes, my parents actually chose to spell my name this way.
