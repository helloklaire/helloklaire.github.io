Hello there! I'm Klaire. I'm an academic-slash-data enthusiast. I like figuring out how humans and machines interact. I also want to understand the human condition, one dataset at a time.

### My work.
You can find my published papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=u8mk81AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) or [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7521-1425).
I also share materials, data or code in my [OSF](https://osf.io/thdjz/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/helloklaire) accounts.

### My pronouns.
I identify as non-binary and use the pronouns she/they. It means you can use 'she/her' or 'they/them' pronouns when referring to me. 

If you’re unsure about someone's pronouns, just ask :) Asking whether someone should be referred to as “he”, “she”, “they” or any another pronoun may feel awkward at first, but it is one of the simplest ways to show respect for someone’s identity.
